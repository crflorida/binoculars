Files in this Project:
binoculars.html: This file contains the HTML structure and CSS styles required to display the binoculars.
How to Use:
1. Download the HTML File:
Ensure you have the binoculars.html file on your local machine or directly access its contents.

2. Copy the HTML Code:
You can directly copy the HTML and CSS from the file or follow the steps below to include it in an existing webpage.

3. Integrating into a Website:
Option 1: Adding to a Standalone Page
If you want to use the binoculars animation on its own page:

Save the provided HTML code in a new file called binoculars.html.
Open the file in any browser to see the binoculars animation.
Option 2: Embedding into an Existing Website
If you want to embed the animation into an existing website:

Open your HTML file where you'd like to add the binoculars.
Copy the content of the binoculars.html file and paste it between the <body> tags of your existing HTML file.
Make sure the <style> section from the file is also included within the <head> of your main file to ensure the animation functions correctly.

For example, you can add the binoculars section like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Binoculars Animation</title>
    <style>
        /* Paste the CSS part here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Add the binoculars section -->
    <div class="binoculars">
        <div class="back-bino"></div>
        <div class="left-bino"></div>
        <div class="right-bino"></div>
        <div class="left-bino-lense">
            <div class="eye"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="right-bino-lense">
            <div class="eye"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

Customization:

Modify the animation-duration and animation-delay values to speed up or slow down the animation.

Troubleshooting:
Ensure your HTML structure includes the correct CSS to avoid any styling issues.
Always verify the viewport meta tag is present for responsive behavior.
